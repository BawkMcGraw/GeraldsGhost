# GroupMe Story Bot Gerald
it randomly combines story sections to generate unique stories when called in the groupme server. It includes a plethora of other features:
* cooldown timer for too many requests, to prevent chat spam
* text based easter egg hunt with score scoring in postgreSQL
* multiple group support
* keeps stats for how many stories were requested and can post to the group
* parses large story strings into multiple messages to avoid groupme character limitations.
